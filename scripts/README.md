# scripts

This folder contains reusable scripts for the bloxyscriptmaster project. Add your scripts here organized by language or feature.

Guidelines:
- Use descriptive filenames (e.g. feature_name.lua)
- Include a short header comment at the top of each script explaining its purpose and usage

Example file included: example_script.lua — a simple starter Roblox Lua script.
